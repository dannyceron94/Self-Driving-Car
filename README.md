An obstacle avoidance sensor consists of:
  infrared-transmitter,
  infrared-receiver,
  potentiometer.
  
 If there is no obstacle, emitted infrared ray will disappear. If the infrared ray encounters an obstacle, it will be reflected back to the infrared-receiver. Then the infrared-receiver will detect this signal and confirm an obstacle ahead.
